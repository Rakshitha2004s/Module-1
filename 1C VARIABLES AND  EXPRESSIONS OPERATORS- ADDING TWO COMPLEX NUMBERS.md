# Experiment No: 1c-Varibles and Expressions, Operators - Adding Two Complex Numbers

## AIM
To write a Python program for two values using all the relational operators (>,<,>=,<=,== ,!=).

## ALGORITHM
Start Assign values a = 13 and b = 33 Compare a and b using > , < , >= , <= , == , != Print the results of each comparison Stop

## PROGRAM

# Reg.No-212222060245
# Name-Singamala Rakshitha
#Write your code here
```
a = 13
b = 33
# a > b is False
print(a > b)
# a < b is True
print(a < b)
# a == b is False
print(a == b)
# a != b is True
print(a != b)
# a >= b is False
print(a >= b)
# a <= b is True
print(a <= b)
```
